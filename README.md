# Hi, I'm Paul Coetser.

I am a Full-Stack Developer, doing both Back and Front End work. I have extensive experience designing, developing & building Internet Applications, Websites and Databases. I am a registered Drupal Developer with both Drupal.org and Acquia.

- I previously worked at **[SEGA](https://sega.com/), [Cancer Research](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/) &amp; [EDF Energy](https://www.edfenergy.com/prettycurious)**
- I work mostly with Drupal 7/8/9, PHP, React & VueJS
- I also have experience with the large majority of current JS frameworks such as Vue, React & Webpack, together with Grunt & Gulp
- [**@sveltekit**](https://svelte.dev/) is my current tool of choice for creating web apps
- Sometimes I fiddle around with **Python (Django &amp; Flask)**

## Latest Projects

- Just for kicks, I've built a Hulu Interface that pulls info from the IMDB API.
- I have deployed this app to firebase at [https://hulu-clone-f9922.web.app/](https://hulu-clone-f9922.web.app/).
